# MissedCounter
A tutorial plugin that simply shows how many notes you've missed.

# What Is This?
This is a tutorial plugin for the unofficial [Beat Saber modding wiki](https://wiki.assistant.moe/modding/example-mod). This plugin will rarely be updated, with exceptions being game-breaking bugs and newer Beat Saber updates.

Copy and study this as you wish. All I ask is for you to not copy and claim as your own mod (Because trust me, the admins know I made this plugin)
